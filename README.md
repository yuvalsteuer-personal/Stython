# Stython - A incomplete python interpreter
Stython is a imperfect python interpreter written in C++, my goal with Stython is to tackle the program of building a text parser/processor while experimenting with Git and coding projects at a larger scale.
## Next Build
Next build will include support and code clean-up of various source files and classes, parsing class will be added as well as various other capabilities and functionality such as:

- [ ] _Types:_ ```'int'```,```'bool'```,```'str'```,```'list'```.
- [ ] _Functions:_ ```len()```,```type()```,```del```,```print```.
- [ ]  _Assignment Operator_ ```=```
- [ ] _Expression Parser_
