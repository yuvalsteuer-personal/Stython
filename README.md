# Stython - A incomplete python interpreter
Stython is a imperfect python interpreter written in C++, my goal with Stython is to tackle the program of building a text parser/processor while experimenting with Git and coding projects at a larger scale.


## Next Build (
Next build will include a lexer (for converting the input into tokens),
And hopefully will also include a parser. current plans include lexer/parser implementation via flex (the fast lexer analyzer) and bison (the gnu parser) respectivly.

## Preceding Build
The build preceding the next one will include support and code clean-up of various source files and classes, parsing class will be added as well as various other capabilities and functionality such as:

- [ ] _Types:_ ```'int'```,```'bool'```,```'str'```,```'list'```.
- [ ] _Functions:_ ```len()```,```type()```,```del```,```print```.
- [ ]  _Assignment Operator_ ```=```
- [ ] _Expression Parser_
